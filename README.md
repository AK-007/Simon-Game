# Simon-Game
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds,the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.This is one of the projects included in [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) course.
